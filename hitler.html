            <h1>Adolf Hitler</h1>
            <p class="text">Adolf Hitler ( Braunau am Inn ( Austria ), April 20 , 1889 - Berlin , April 30, 1945 ) is a German politician, appointed German Chancellor in 1933 , with dictatorial powers from 1934. The leader (German FÃ¼hrer ) of the German National Socialist Workers' Party and Nazi Germany since 1933 . until 1945 .

                As a representative of the German extreme right, Hitler took advantage of the dissatisfaction of a large part of the German people with the economic crisis and imposed reparations from the First World War and with his party won two consecutive parliamentary elections in 1932, after which, in 1933, Paul von Hindenburg appointed him chancellor. A year later, in 1934, with the support of all German parties except the SPD , he excluded the parliament from the law-making process and thereby practically established a party and personal dictatorship that culminated in 1939 with the initiation of wars of conquest and the genocide of individual European nations, above all Jews (see: Holocaust ).
                
                Hitler's attempt to create a Greater Germany ( Grossdeutschland ), first by peaceful means: lobbying with the great powers as well as through mass marches and referendums succeeded in a short period of time in the annexation of Austria ( Anschluss ), as well as certain parts of Czechoslovakia with German elements. Failing to do the same with Poland, to force the return of the territories that were lost after the First World War, Hitler carried out the invasion in 1939 . misjudging that Great Britain and France would not come to the rescue. With this attack, the Second World War began - a six-year conflict between the Axis and the Allies .
                
                Hitler was also the main ideologist of the racial policy of Nazi Germany, which he announced already in the book Mein Kampf (My Struggle) in 1924. Under his rule, Jews (more than five million) and Roma were exterminated in the Holocaust .
                
                Hitler's dream - to create a thousand-year Reich , a super state in which the German people would have absolute power - was broken on April 30, 1945 , when Hitler committed suicide in his bunker, in front of the advancing Soviet Red Army .</p>
