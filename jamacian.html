            <h1>Jamacian Smile</h1>
            <p>Jamaican Smile, also known as Jamaican Smiling, refers to an ironic Sigma slang term that riffs on the term similar to other nationality-based terms like German Stare and Balkan Rage. Therefore, the Jamaican Smile is not a real phenomenon and instead, its usage mocks other Sigma brainrot terms like Winter Arc and Balkan Rage and Those Who Know, which were all popularized in late 2024, predominantly used withing Sigma Phonk edits featuring the creepy Trollface variant Trollge.On September 30th, 2024, TikToker[1] @bestsparring posted a photo slideshow using a phonk sound, showing a transition between two halves of a Trollface with text captions reading, "About to fight / Opponent starts Jamaican smiling." Over nine days, the slideshow received roughly 55,900 likes (photos shown below).On October 2nd, 2024, TikToker[2] @bestsparring posted another photo slideshow that used the same format as the Flicker Goon slideshow, instead reading, "I can Jamaican smile for 7 seconds." The photos received over 145,300 likes in one week After the abovementioned slideshow, others evolved the joke. For instance, on October 2nd, TikToker[3] @shanie.44 posted a video using the I'm Stronger, I'm Smarter, I'm Better sound, adding a POV caption reading, "POV: I'm the only one that can hold a Jamaican smile," receiving over 342,100 plays and 2,700 likes in a weekOn October 4th, TikToker[4] @jetskips posted a phonk edit that referenced the Y'all Don't Know About the Kodiak Bear meme and offered the Jamaican Smile, among other nationality sigma moves, as a countermove, receiving over 2.9 million plays and 424,800 likes in five days.On October 5th, 2024, X[5] user @seiyaposting reposted a screenshot of the original Jamaican Smile photo from TikTok,[1] receiving over 9,600 likes in four days.

                On October 7th, X[6] user @PollensStuff posted a Trollge GIF with a caption that joked about Jamaican Smiling and other phonk and brainrot terms, receiving over 290 likes in two days (shown below).</p>
